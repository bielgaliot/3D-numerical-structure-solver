Discrete element method approximation to a wing beam and a truss-structure glider

The Wing Beam outputs a graph showing the approximation for different number of elements used

The Glider outputs a  representation of axial compression and traction loads as well as a warning on which of the bars are in risk of buckling. There is a selector for a simulated increase in the loads in the form of a gust of wind (0/1) ad a selector for the diameter of the bars which would be in risk of buckling with the gust of wind.
